# CUFitt Service360 – Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the **intentional evolution** of CUFitt Service360.  
It prioritizes service impact, adoption, and trust over feature volume.

Execution follows the guiding principle: **Execution with precision.**

---

## Phase 1 – Foundation (Current)

**Objective:** Establish a credit-union-native service data model for Dynamics 365.

### Scope
- Core schema definitions:
  - Member
  - Household
  - Share
  - Loan
- Service-focused, read-only design
- Documentation and governance
- Open-source release (MIT license)

### Outcomes
- Clear, adoptable schema for CU service teams
- Low-friction evaluation by credit unions
- Foundation for analytics and automation

---

## Phase 2 – Visibility & Insight

**Objective:** Improve service awareness without operational risk.

### Planned Enhancements
- Service interaction entity
- Case entity extensions for CU-specific context
- Power BI sample dashboards:
  - Member overview
  - Household exposure
  - Share and loan inquiry patterns
- Basic entity relationship diagrams

### Outcomes
- Faster agent onboarding
- Reduced average handle time (AHT)
- Improved service consistency

---

## Phase 3 – Intelligence & Automation

**Objective:** Introduce intelligence while preserving compliance.

### Planned Enhancements
- Copilot-ready entity summaries
- Read-only automation patterns
- Service risk and churn indicators
- Optional Fabric-based data pipelines (reference architecture)

### Outcomes
- Proactive service insights
- Better issue prioritization
- Foundation for AI-assisted service

---

## Phase 4 – Enterprise Extensions (Optional)

**Objective:** Support scaled and regulated environments.

### Potential Extensions
- Managed solution packaging
- AppSource distribution
- Compliance hardening packs
- Partner and CUSO enablement

These extensions will **never gate** access to the open-core schema.

## Non-Goals

Service360 explicitly does **not** aim to:
- Replace core banking systems
- Perform financial transactions
- Become a loan or deposit platform
- Compete with CU cores or LOS vendors

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Open by default**
- **Service-first, not transactional**
- **Composable and extensible**
- **Compliance-aware**
- **Community-driven, stewarded by CUFitt**

---

## Contribution Alignment

Contributions are evaluated against:
- Service value
- Simplicity
- Credit union relevance
- Long-term maintainability

Features that introduce unnecessary complexity or operational risk may be declined.

---

## Roadmap Governance

- The roadmap is maintained by **CUFitt**
- Updates are versioned and transparent
- Community input is welcomed via Issues and Discussions
- Execution favors quality over speed

---

## Disclaimer

This roadmap represents **direction**, not commitment.  
Priorities may evolve based on community feedback, Microsoft platform changes, and regulatory considerations.

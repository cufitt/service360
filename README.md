# CUFitt Service360

**Execution with precision.**

CUFitt Service360 is an open-source, credit-union-specific data model and accelerator for **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service**, designed to deliver a true 360-degree member view for frontline service teams.

## Why Service360?
Credit unions using Dynamics 365 often struggle with generic CRM entities that do not reflect core credit union concepts such as shares, dividends, householding, and loan relationships. Service360 fills this gap with a purpose-built, community-driven extension.

## What’s Included (Phase 1)
- Credit-union-native Dataverse entities and relationships
- Sample forms and views for Customer Service
- Documentation and schema diagrams
- Public demo environment (coming soon)

## What’s Not Included (By Design)
- Core banking integrations
- Bots or Copilot implementations
- Fraud or AML modules
- Managed AppSource solution

## Status
🚧 Early development – community feedback welcome.

## Governance
Service360 follows a core maintainer model led by **CUFitt**, with open contributions via pull requests.

## Project Steward
CUFitt Service360 is created and maintained by **Sai Turlapati**,  
Microsoft MVP and founder of **CUFitt**.

The project follows a stewarded open-source model, with CUFitt acting
as the long-term maintainer and roadmap owner.

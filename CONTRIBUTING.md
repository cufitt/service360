# Contributing to CUFitt Service360

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **CUFitt Service360**.

Service360 is an open-source, credit-union-focused service model designed for clarity, stability, and long-term adoption. Contributions are welcome, but must align with the project’s guiding principles and scope.

## Guiding Principles

All contributions must:
- Be **service-focused**, not transactional

- Documentation enhancements
- Diagrams and visual artifacts
- Issue reports and design discussions
- Feedback from credit unions and Microsoft partners

## What We Do Not Accept (Phase 1)

The following are out of scope for Phase 1:
- Core banking integrations
- Transaction processing logic
- Automated financial workflows
- Bot or Copilot implementations
- Breaking schema changes without clear justification

These areas may be revisited in future phases.
